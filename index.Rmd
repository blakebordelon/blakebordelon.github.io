## About

I am Blake Bordelon, an applied mathematics graduate student with research interests that lie in the convex hull of machine learning, statistical mechanics, and theoretical neuroscience. I work in Cengiz Pehlevan's group at Harvard. I am interested in understanding neural networks: optimization, representation, and generalization. My CV is here. 

## Papers

B. Bordelon, A. Canatar, and C. Pehlevan, [“Spectrum Dependent Learning Curves in Kernel Regression and Wide Neural Networks,”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02561) International Conference of Machine Learning (ICML), 2020.



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
