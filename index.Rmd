## About

I am Blake Bordelon, an applied mathematics student in [Cengiz Pehlevan's Group](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. My research interests lie in the convex hull of machine learning, statistical mechanics, and theoretical neuroscience. I am interested in understanding neural networks.
