I am Blake Bordelon, an applied math PhD student in the [Pehlevan Group](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. My research interests lie in the convex hull of machine learning, statistical physics, and theoretical neuroscience. Before graduate school, I studied physics, engineering, and computer science at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). 

My works can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yeQ8_pgAAAAJ&hl=en). I also occasionally post new preprints on [twitter](https://twitter.com/blake__bordelon).
