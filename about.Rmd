### Kernel Regression Generalization: Spectral Bias and Multiple Descents 
This [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XNVNLcUzlpWT0jwS5__p0qXhF7P9tGqd?usp=sharing) contains an introduction to an average case analysis of generalization in kernel regression, exploring spectral bias and the non-monotonicity of the risk curves in the presence of noise.
